        <h1>Utilities</h1>

<p>This is a set of classes designed for use in Windows 8 WWAs using the WinJS frameworks.</p>

<p>There are a number of parts to this:</p>

<h2>Shared Utilities</h2>

<p>These are some common utility functions that allow you to write better code across the board.</p>

<h3>appassert, alert</h3>

<p>Because WWA's don't have an <code>alert</code> function, and instead have <code>Windows.UI.Popup.MessageBox</code>, there is a convenient replacement that looks like your mothers alert, but is async (since sync message boxes aren't possible in WWAs). Just call <code>alert</code> and all will be good.</p>

<p>Additionally, theres a basic assert through <code>appassert</code>, (named so as not to conflict with QUnit's assert class). This is like like a normal <code>assert</code>:
<code>appassert(condition, message)</code></p>

<p>If condition is not truthy, the previously mentioned <code>alert</code> is used to show a message to the consumer. If a debugger is attached, then the debugger will immediately break at this point too.</p>

<h3>Signal</h3>

<p>WinJS introduces a powerful async parttern through Promises. However, sometimes, creating promises to perform &amp; share promise patterns for your own async code is hard:</p>

<pre><code>var complete, error, progress;    
var promise = new WinJS.Promise(function(c, e, p) {    
    complete = c; error = e; progress = progress;    
});
</code></pre>

<p>And thats before you start sharing them around and raising the completion etc at the correct times.</p>

<p>Using Codevoid.Utilities.Signal, this is a lot easier:</p>

<pre><code>var signal = new Codevoid.Utilities.Signal();
signal.complete();
return signal.promise;
</code></pre>

<h2>OAuth Helper</h2>

<p>Writing OAuth requests is a pain in the behind. While Windows 8 provides a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.authentication.web.aspx">basic</a> way to obtain the secret tokens from the web flow, it doesn't actually make it easy to sign the requests etc. While the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Web-Authentication-d0485122">sample</a> explains it, it doesn't make it really easy when you need to do the whole OAuth 1.0 request signing shinangians.</p>

<p>This class attempts to solve that by providing a WinJS.Promise based API that allows chaining, errors etc to propogate. It's simple to use, and I would recommend looking deeper into the tests to use it. However, simple usage:</p>

<pre><code>var url = "http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json"  
var request = new Codevoid.OAuth.OAuthRequest(clientInfo, url);

request.data = [{ key: "status", value: "Test@Status %78 update: " + Date.now() }];
request.send().done(function (resultData) {
    var result = JSON.parse(resultData);
},
</code></pre>

<p>Thats all there is too it. You get the raw response back, and you can do whatever you want.</p>
